title: About Me
---

I am a data scientist based in London working in the EdTech sector, where, amongst other things, I use data to improve instruction and curriculum design. 

I am passionate about increasing the use of evidence and statistics to guide social policy. I spend much of my free time working with publically available datasets to explore London demographics, 
social issues and infrastructure. I mainly code in R and particularly enjoy data visualisation.

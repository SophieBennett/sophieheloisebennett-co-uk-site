      <title>Why Linear Regression Estimates the Conditional Mean</title>

IntroductionIf you look at any textbook on linear regression, you will find that it says the following:
“Linear regression estimates the conditional mean of the response variable.”
This means that, for a given value of the predictor variable \(X\), linear regression will give you the mean value of the response variable \(Y\).</description>

      <title>Animal Crossing New Horizons: A New Birthday Problem</title>

      <description>pre.r { color:#000;background-color:#ECECEC;}In a room of 23 people, what’s the probability that at least two of them will share the same birthday? The answer is around 50%, a lot more than people usually expect.
This is an example of the classic Birthday Problem. The trick to calculating it is to start by calculating the complement, - i.e. the probability that no one in the room shares the same birthday.</description>

It’s great for a number of reasons; t helps you maintain your muscles as you get older and build stronger bones, it can help improve your posture and give you a more toned body, and you get a sense of relatively rapid progression.</description>

      <title>Is Your Box of Celebrations Chocolates Biased?</title>

      <description>pre.r { color:#000;background-color:#ECECEC;}We surely all know the feeling of disappointment when the best chocolates in the Celebrations box are all gone and there’s only the rubbish ones left in the tub. Myself being particularly fond of the Malteasers and Galaxy chocolates, I’ve often felt a little suspicious that there might not be as many of them in a box than the other chocolates. But, I’ve never had a chance to put my suspicions to the test…</description>

      <title>Predicting School GCSE grades</title>

      <description>pre.r { color:#000;background-color:#ECECEC;}Every year, the UK government releases a comprehensive dataset showing average GCSE grades at each school alongside demographic information about the schools. You can download the data yourself here.
For obvious anonymity reasons, the government don’t provide the grades of individual students. Nonetheless, it’s a fascinating dataset that can be used to look at the relationship between different demographic variables and educational achievement, as well as to track changes in GCSE results overtime.</description>

      <description>…Just kidding (I think!). But this dataset of average daily entries and exits at each Underground station certainly makes it look like there are.
Exhibit 1: A plot showing the average daily entries made across all tube stations between 2007-2017.
Exhibit 2: A plot of both average entries and exits made per day between 2007-2017:
Whoops! Those poor commuters.
TfL do provide an explanation for the discrepancy. In fact, they offer three:</description>

      <title>Cleaning Dirty Excel Sheets in R</title>

      <description>pre.r { color:#000;background-color:#ECECEC;}I spend a great deal of my spare time searching for, and playing with, open source data. Although it’s great fun, a challenge of working with this kind of data is that it usually isn’t stored in a tidy format. Very occasionally, I’ll find a carefully constructed csv made by a generous soul, but most often what I get is a somewhat messy Excel file.</description>

      <description>Now, I’m the kind of big tube fanatic who has completed the “Can you name all the stations on the London Underground?” sporcle quiz more times than I can count. But even I have to acknowledge one major drawback of the london tube: it can get really hot down there!
I’ve long suspected the Central line of being the biggest offender in this department, putting it near the bottom in my ranking of favourite tube lines.</description>

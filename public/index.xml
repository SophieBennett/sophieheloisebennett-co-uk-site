      <description>Every year, the UK government releases a comprehensive dataset showing average GCSE grades at each school alongside demographic information about the schools. You can download the data yourself here.
For obvious anonymity reasons, the government don’t provide the grades of individual students. Nonetheless, it’s a fascinating dataset that can be used to look at the relationship between different demographic variables and educational achievement, as well as to track changes in GCSE results overtime.</description>

      <description>…Just kidding (I think!). But this dataset of average daily entries and exits at each Underground station certainly makes it look like there are.
Exhibit 1: A plot showing the average daily entries made across all tube stations between 2007-2017.
Exhibit 2: A plot of both average entries and exits made per day between 2007-2017:
Whoops! Those poor commuters.
TfL do provide an explanation for the discrepancy. In fact, they offer three:</description>

      <title>Cleaning Dirty Excel Sheets in R</title>

      <description>pre.r { color:#000;background-color:#ECECEC;}I spend a great deal of my spare time searching for, and playing with, open source data. Although it’s great fun, a challenge of working with this kind of data is that it usually isn’t stored in a tidy format. Very occasionally, I’ll find a carefully constructed csv made by a generous soul, but most often what I get is a somewhat messy Excel file.</description>

      <description>Now, I’m the kind of big tube fanatic who has completed the “Can you name all the stations on the London Underground?” sporcle quiz more times than I can count. But even I have to acknowledge one major drawback of the london tube: it can get really hot down there!
I’ve long suspected the Central line of being the biggest offender in this department, putting it near the bottom in my ranking of favourite tube lines.</description>

      <description>I am a data scientist based in London working in the EdTech sector, where, amongst other things, I use data to improve instruction and curriculum design.
I am passionate about increasing the use of evidence and statistics to guide social policy. I spend much of my free time working with publically available datasets to explore London demographics, social issues and infrastructure. I mainly code in R and particularly enjoy data visualisation.</description>
